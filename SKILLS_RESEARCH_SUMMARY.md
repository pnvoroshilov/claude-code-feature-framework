# Claude Skills Research Summary

## Executive Summary

I've conducted comprehensive research on Claude Code Skills by studying:
- Official Anthropic documentation on Agent Skills
- Claude Skills Cookbook repository with real examples
- Best practices from official guidelines
- Actual skill implementations from the cookbooks

Based on this research, I've created:
1. **Skills Creator Agent** - Expert agent for creating well-structured skills
2. **Business Requirements Analysis Skill** - Example skill following official format

## Key Findings from Official Documentation

### 1. What Are Skills?

**Skills are modular capability packages** that extend Claude's functionality. Each skill contains:
- **SKILL.md**: Main definition file with instructions and capabilities
- **Metadata**: Frontmatter with name, description, version, tags
- **Scripts** (optional): Executable code for complex operations
- **Resources** (optional): Templates, configs, sample data

### 2. Skill File Structure

#### Single-File Skill (Simple)
```
skill-name.md
```

#### Multi-File Skill (Complex)
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Main definition
├── scripts/              # Optional: Python/JS code
│   ├── processor.py
│   └── helpers.py
└── resources/            # Optional: Supporting files
    ├── templates/
    └── data/
```

### 3. SKILL.md Structure (Official Format)

Based on actual examples from the cookbook:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name-kebab-case
description: Clear one-sentence description of skill purpose
version: 1.0.0  # Optional
tags: [tag1, tag2]  # Optional
---

# Skill Display Name

Brief overview paragraph.

## Output Format
Describe what the skill produces:
- Output types (files, reports, data)
- Formatting standards
- Quality expectations

## Example Usage
Real-world examples with natural language:
> "Create an Excel report from this CSV data"

## Scripts (if multi-file)

```

### 4. Metadata Frontmatter Guidelines

**Required Fields:**
```yaml
---
name: skill-name-in-kebab-case
description: One-sentence description under 150 characters
---
```

**Optional Fields:**
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Short description
version: 1.0.0                    # Semantic versioning
author: Team Name                  # Attribution
tags: [analysis, finance, excel]   # Categorization (3-5 tags)
requires: [code-execution]         # Dependencies
integrates: [xlsx, pptx]          # Works with skills
language: python                   # Primary script language
---
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use **kebab-case** for names (lowercase-with-hyphens)
- Keep descriptions to **one sentence** (< 150 chars)
- Choose **descriptive, searchable** names
- Add **3-5 relevant tags** for discoverability
- Document **dependencies** explicitly

## Official Best Practices

### 1. Discoverability
**Make skills easy to find:**
- Clear, descriptive names (no generic names like "helper" or "tool1")
- Concise, specific descriptions
- Relevant keywords in metadata
- Comprehensive capability lists
- Natural language usage examples

**Good Names:**
- `analyzing-financial-statements` ✅
- `applying-brand-guidelines` ✅
- `git-workflow-automation` ✅

**Poor Names:**
- `tool1` ❌
- `my-skill` ❌
- `helper` ❌

### 2. Clarity
**Ensure instructions are unambiguous:**
- Start with capability overview
- Use active voice and action verbs
- Provide specific examples, not generalities
- Define input/output formats explicitly
- Include format specifications

**Clear Example:**
```markdown
## Input Format
CSV file with required columns:
- `date`: YYYY-MM-DD format
- `amount`: Numeric, USD currency
- `category`: One of [income, expense, transfer]
```

**Unclear Example:**
```markdown
## Input Format
Provide your data in a suitable format.
```

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
**Load information in stages:**
- High-level overview first (always loaded)
- Detailed instructions next (loaded when needed)
- Scripts and resources last (loaded when executed)
- Reference instead of embedding
- Keep SKILL.md focused on "what," not "how"

**Structure:**
```
SKILL.md → Overview + Capabilities (always loaded)
   ↓
Scripts (loaded when code execution needed)
   ↓
Resources (loaded when referenced)
```

### 4. Completeness
**Include all necessary information:**
- ✅ Capabilities: What the skill can do
- ✅ Usage: How to invoke it
- ✅ Input/Output: Format specifications
- ✅ Examples: Concrete use cases
- ✅ Limitations: What it cannot do
- ✅ Best Practices: How to use effectively

### 5. Composability
**Design skills to work together:**
- Reference other skills when appropriate
- Define clear input/output contracts
- Use standard data formats (CSV, JSON)
- Enable chaining and workflows
- Avoid duplication of existing skills

### 6. Maintainability
**Make skills easy to update:**
- Use versioning in frontmatter
- Document changes in version history
- Separate concerns (SKILL.md vs scripts)
- Keep resources modular
- Use clear naming conventions

## Real Examples from Official Cookbook

### Example 1: Financial Analysis Skill

**File:** `analyzing-financial-statements/SKILL.md`

**Key Features:**
- Clear frontmatter with name and description
- Comprehensive capabilities list (Profitability, Liquidity, Leverage, Efficiency, Valuation ratios)
- Explicit input/output formats
- Natural language usage examples
- Multi-file structure with scripts:
  - `calculate_ratios.py` - Main calculation engine
  - `interpret_ratios.py` - Interpretation and benchmarking
- Best practices section
- Limitations clearly stated
- Troubleshooting guidance

**Structure:**
```
analyzing-financial-statements/
├── SKILL.md
├── calculate_ratios.py
└── interpret_ratios.py
```

### Example 2: Brand Guidelines Skill

**File:** `applying-brand-guidelines/SKILL.md`

**Key Features:**
- Detailed brand identity specification
- Visual standards (color palette with hex codes)
- Typography hierarchy (fonts, sizes, usage)
- Document-specific formatting rules
- Content guidelines (tone of voice, standard phrases)
- Quality checklist
- Prohibited elements list
- Application instructions

**Unique Aspects:**
- Prescriptive content (exact colors, fonts, layouts)
- Company-specific information
- Multi-format guidance (PowerPoint, Excel, PDF)
- Compliance validation

## Content Formatting Guidelines

### Heading Hierarchy
```markdown
# Main Skill Title (H1) - Once at top
## Major Sections (H2) - Capabilities, Usage, Examples
### Subsections (H3) - Specific categories
#### Details (H4) - Fine-grained info
```

### Lists and Formatting
- **Bullets**: Unordered capabilities
- **Numbers**: Sequential steps
- **Bold**: `**Important terms**`
- **Code**: `` `technical_terms` ``
- **Code Blocks**: Triple backticks with language
- **Tables**: Structured data presentation

### Example Code Block
````markdown
```python
# Example with syntax highlighting
def calculate_ratio(numerator, denominator):
    return numerator / denominator if denominator != 0 else None
```
````

### Example Table
```markdown
| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| name  | string | Yes | Company name |
| value | number | Yes | Metric value |
```

## Conclusion

Based on thorough research of official Anthropic documentation and real-world examples from the Claude Cookbooks, I've created:

1. **A comprehensive Skills Creator agent** that embodies all best practices and can generate any type of skill following official guidelines

2. **A properly structured example skill** (Business Requirements Analysis) that demonstrates the exact format and structure expected

The research revealed that Claude Skills follow a well-defined structure with:
- Mandatory frontmatter (name, description)
- Standard sections (Capabilities, Usage, Input/Output, Examples, Best Practices, Limitations)
- Clear formatting guidelines (markdown, heading hierarchy)
- Progressive disclosure architecture
- Emphasis on discoverability, clarity, and composability

These deliverables provide everything needed to create the remaining 9 skills for the ClaudeTask framework with consistent quality and adherence to official best practices.
