Purpose: Test if the improved hook triggers correctly on git push with changes.

Hook improvements:
1. Created separate hook script (.claude/hooks/post-push-docs.sh)
2. Added lockfile mechanism to prevent recursion
3. Added [skip-hook] tag detection in commit messages
4. Better error handling and logging
5. Using PostToolUse with Bash(git*) matcher
6. Script receives command via arguments
