## Command Usage Best Practices

### 1. Workflow Commands

**Follow the sequence**:
```
/start-feature → Development → /test → Review → /PR → /merge
```

**Don't skip phases**: Each phase builds on the previous one.

**Wait for completion**: Let automated agents finish before proceeding.

### 2. Testing Commands

**Always save URLs**: Testing URLs must be saved to task database.

**Document results**: Fill out test-plan.md thoroughly.

**Report bugs**: Note all issues found during testing.

### 3. PR Commands

**Verify prerequisites**: Ensure all documents exist before creating PR.

**Review PR description**: Check that PR accurately describes changes.

**Wait for checks**: Let CI/CD complete before merging.

### 4. Documentation Commands

**Run after merges**: Keep documentation current after changes.

**Use specific scopes**: Target only affected documentation areas.

**Review changes**: Verify auto-generated docs are accurate.

### 5. Skill and Hook Commands

**Test thoroughly**: Test custom skills and hooks before relying on them.

**Document usage**: Add clear instructions in skill/hook files.

**Version control**: Commit custom skills and hooks to repository.

## Command Aliases

Some commands have shorter aliases:

| Full Command | Alias | Description |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| `/start-feature` | `/sf` | Start feature analysis |
| `/start-develop` | `/sd` | Start development |
| `/test` | `/t` | Setup test environment |
| `/PR` | `/pr` | Create pull request |
| `/merge` | `/m` | Merge and cleanup |
| `/update-documentation` | `/doc` | Update docs |

**Example**:
```
/sf 42    # Same as /start-feature 42
/sd 42    # Same as /start-develop 42
/t 42     # Same as /test 42
```

## Troubleshooting Commands

### Command Not Found

**Symptom**: Slash command doesn't execute

**Solutions**:
- Verify command exists in `framework-assets/claude-commands/`
- Check command file has correct frontmatter
- Ensure project is in correct mode (SIMPLE vs DEVELOPMENT)
- Check Claude Code session is active

### Command Fails Silently

**Symptom**: Command runs but produces no output

**Solutions**:
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify MCP server is running
- Check task status prerequisites
- Verify all required files exist

### Agent Delegation Fails

**Symptom**: Command starts but agent doesn't respond

**Solutions**:
- Verify agent file exists in `framework-assets/claude-agents/`
- Check agent has correct tools in frontmatter
- Verify agent has access to required context
- Check for agent execution errors in logs

## Custom Commands

### Creating Custom Commands

1. Create command file: `.claude/commands/my-command.md`
2. Add frontmatter:
```markdown
---

argument-hint: [args]
description: My custom command description
---

# My Custom Command

Command implementation goes here...
```

3. Save file and reload Claude Code session
4. Command available as `/my-command`

### Command File Structure

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: [list of tools]
argument-hint: [argument hints]
description: Brief description
---

# Command Name

## What it does
Description of command functionality

## Prerequisites
What must be true before running

## Usage
