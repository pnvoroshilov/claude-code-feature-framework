## Quick Start

### Basic Refactoring Workflow

```markdown
Refactoring Checklist:
- [ ] 1. Ensure comprehensive test coverage exists
- [ ] 2. Identify code smell or improvement opportunity
- [ ] 3. Plan small, incremental refactoring steps
- [ ] 4. Execute one refactoring at a time
- [ ] 5. Run tests after each change
- [ ] 6. Commit after successful refactoring
- [ ] 7. Repeat until code meets quality standards
```

### Simple Example: Extract Method

**Before:**
```python
def process_order(order):
    # Validate order
    if not order.customer_id:
        raise ValueError("Customer ID required")
    if not order.items:
        raise ValueError("Order must have items")
    if order.total < 0:
        raise ValueError("Total must be positive")

    # Calculate discounts
    discount = 0
    if order.total > 1000:
        discount = order.total * 0.1
    elif order.total > 500:
        discount = order.total * 0.05

    # Apply discount
    final_total = order.total - discount

    # Save order
    db.save(order)

    return final_total
```

**After:**
```python
def process_order(order):
    validate_order(order)
    discount = calculate_discount(order.total)
    final_total = order.total - discount
    save_order(order)
    return final_total

def validate_order(order):
    if not order.customer_id:
        raise ValueError("Customer ID required")
    if not order.items:
        raise ValueError("Order must have items")
    if order.total < 0:
        raise ValueError("Total must be positive")

def calculate_discount(total):
    if total > 1000:
        return total * 0.1
    elif total > 500:
        return total * 0.05
    return 0

def save_order(order):
    db.save(order)
```

**Benefits**: Improved readability, testability, reusability, and single responsibility.

2. Extract each responsibility into separate function
3. Give functions intention-revealing names
4. Verify tests still pass
5. Remove temporary variables where possible

**Result**: Smaller, focused functions that are easier to test and maintain

### Example 2: Class-Level Refactoring

**Scenario**: God class with 1000+ lines and 50+ methods

**Approach**:
1. Group related methods and fields
2. Extract cohesive groups into new classes
3. Use composition to connect new classes
4. Maintain original interface for backward compatibility
5. Gradually migrate callers to new structure

**Result**: Multiple focused classes with clear responsibilities

### Example 3: Removing Code Duplication

**Scenario**: Same logic repeated in 5 different places

**Approach**:
1. Identify the duplicated code pattern
2. Extract to shared function/method
3. Parameterize variations
4. Replace all duplicates with function calls
5. Add tests for the extracted function

**Result**: Single source of truth, easier maintenance

### Example 4: Simplifying Complex Conditionals

**Scenario**: Nested if/else statements 6 levels deep

**Approach**:
1. Extract boolean expressions to named methods
2. Use guard clauses for early returns
3. Replace nested conditionals with polymorphism
4. Use strategy pattern for complex branching
5. Apply lookup tables for switch statements

**Result**: Linear, readable code flow

### Example 5: Performance Optimization

**Scenario**: Application slow due to N+1 queries

**Approach**:
1. Profile to identify bottleneck
2. Analyze database query patterns
3. Add eager loading/batch fetching
4. Implement caching layer
5. Measure performance improvement

**Result**: 10x-100x performance increase

### Example 6: Modernizing Legacy Code

**Result**: Modern, maintainable codebase

## When to Use This Skill

### Perfect for:
- **Code Reviews**: Identify improvements during PR review
- **Technical Debt Sprints**: Dedicated refactoring work
- **Performance Issues**: Optimize slow code paths
- **Before New Features**: Clean up area before adding features
- **Legacy Maintenance**: Improve old codebases
- **Test Addition**: Restructure for testability
- **Onboarding**: Make code clearer for new developers

### Not Ideal for:
- **Tight Deadlines**: Refactoring needs time and tests
- **Unstable Code**: Need tests first
- **Unclear Requirements**: Understand the domain first
- **Broken Features**: Fix bugs before refactoring
- **New Greenfield Projects**: Write clean code from start

## Refactoring Principles

### The Rule of Three
First time: just write it. Second time: notice duplication. Third time: refactor.

### Boy Scout Rule
Leave code cleaner than you found it. Small improvements compound.

### Red-Green-Refactor
TDD cycle: failing test → passing test → refactor. Always refactor after green.

### Two Hats
Wear one hat at a time: either adding features OR refactoring. Never both simultaneously.

### Baby Steps
Small, safe changes. Run tests frequently. Commit working code often.

### Preparatory Refactoring
Make change easy, then make easy change. Refactor before adding features.

## Code Quality Metrics

### What to Measure
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Aim for < 10 per function
- **Lines of Code**: Functions < 50 lines, classes < 300 lines
- **Code Coverage**: Aim for 80%+ test coverage
- **Duplication**: < 3% duplicated code
- **Coupling**: Measure dependencies between modules
- **Cohesion**: How focused each module is

### How to Improve

### During Bug Fixes
1. **Understand**: Add characterization tests
2. **Simplify**: Refactor to make bug obvious
3. **Fix**: Correct the issue
4. **Verify**: Ensure tests pass
5. **Cleanup**: Improve surrounding code

### During Code Review
1. **Review**: Identify improvement opportunities
2. **Prioritize**: Critical vs nice-to-have changes
3. **Apply**: Make changes before merge
4. **Document**: Explain refactoring decisions

## Safety Guidelines

### Always Before Refactoring

- ❌ Make large, sweeping changes
- ❌ Ignore failing tests

### After Each Refactoring
- ✅ Run full test suite
- ✅ Verify performance unchanged
- ✅ Check for regressions
- ✅ Commit working code
- ✅ Update documentation if needed

## Language-Specific Considerations
