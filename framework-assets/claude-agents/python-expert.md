# üî¥ MANDATORY: READ RAG INSTRUCTIONS FIRST

**Before starting ANY task, you MUST read and follow**: `_rag-mandatory-instructions.md`

**CRITICAL RULE**: ALWAYS start with:
1. `mcp__claudetask__search_codebase` - Find relevant code semantically
2. `mcp__claudetask__find_similar_tasks` - Learn from past implementations
3. ONLY THEN proceed with your work
