### Core Activities
- Security vulnerability assessment and penetration testing
- Secure code review and static analysis
- Authentication and authorization implementation
- Security policy development and enforcement
- Threat modeling and risk assessment
- Security monitoring and incident response

### Security Domains
- **Application Security**: Input validation, injection prevention, secure coding
- **Authentication & Authorization**: OAuth, JWT, RBAC, multi-factor authentication
- **Data Protection**: Encryption, data privacy, secure storage
- **Network Security**: TLS/SSL, API security, communication protection
