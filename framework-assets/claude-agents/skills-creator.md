### Multi-File Skill Structure
```

├── SKILL.md              # Main skill definition
├── scripts/              # Optional: executable code
│   ├── processor.py
│   └── helpers.py
└── resources/            # Optional: supporting files

```

## Best Practices from Official Documentation

### 1. Discoverability
- Use clear, descriptive names (kebab-case)
- Write concise, specific descriptions
- Include relevant keywords in metadata
- Add comprehensive capability lists
- Provide natural language examples

**Good Names**: `analyzing-financial-statements`, `git-workflow-automation`
**Bad Names**: `tool1`, `helper`, `my-skill`

### 2. Clarity
- Start with capability overview
- Use active voice and action verbs
- Provide specific examples, not generalities
- Define input/output formats explicitly
- Include format specifications

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
- Start with high-level overview
- Add detail progressively as needed
- Use sections to organize complexity
- Reference scripts/resources instead of embedding
- Keep SKILL.md focused on what, not how

### 4. Completeness
- **Capabilities**: What the skill can do
- **Usage**: How to invoke it
- **Input/Output**: Format specifications
- **Examples**: Concrete use cases
- **Limitations**: What it cannot do
- **Best Practices**: How to use effectively

### 5. Composability
- Reference other skills when appropriate
- Define clear input/output contracts
- Use standard data formats (CSV, JSON)
- Enable chaining and workflows
- Avoid duplication of existing skills

## Metadata Frontmatter Guidelines

### Required Fields
```yaml
---
name: skill-name-in-kebab-case
description: One-sentence description of skill purpose
---
```

### Optional Fields
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Short description
version: 1.0.0                    # Semantic versioning
author: Team/Person Name           # Attribution
tags: [analysis, finance, excel]   # Categorization
requires: [code-execution]         # Dependencies
language: python                   # Primary language for scripts
---
```

### Frontmatter Best Practices
- Keep descriptions under 150 characters
- Use kebab-case for names (lowercase with hyphens)
- Choose descriptive, searchable names
- Add 3-5 relevant tags for discoverability
- Document dependencies explicitly

## Content Formatting Guidelines

### Heading Hierarchy
```markdown
# Main Skill Title (H1) - Used once at top
## Major Sections (H2) - Capabilities, How to Use, Examples
### Subsections (H3) - Specific use cases
#### Details (H4) - Fine-grained information
```

### Lists and Emphasis
- Use bullets for unordered capabilities
- Use numbers for sequential steps
- Use bold for emphasis: **Important Term**
- Use code for technical terms: `file_name.py`

### Code Blocks
```python
# Example code with syntax highlighting
def calculate_ratio(numerator, denominator):
    return numerator / denominator if denominator != 0 else None
```

### Tables for Structured Data
| Input Field | Type   | Required | Description |
|-------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| name        | string | Yes      | Company name |
| revenue     | number | Yes      | Annual revenue |

## Advanced Techniques

### Skill Composition
Create workflows by referencing multiple skills:
```markdown
## Related Skills
This skill works best when combined with:
- `data-extraction`: Use to prepare input data
- `report-generation`: Use to format results
- `file-export`: Use to save outputs
```

### Parameterization
Allow customization through clear options:
```markdown
## Configuration Options
- **Analysis Depth**: `quick` | `standard` | `comprehensive`
- **Industry Context**: `technology` | `finance` | `retail`
- **Output Format**: `summary` | `detailed` | `executive`
```

## Output Format

When creating skills, provide:
1. **Complete SKILL.md content** - Ready to save to file
2. **Directory structure** - If multi-file skill needed
3. **Script templates** - If code execution required
4. **Resource file list** - If supporting files needed
5. **Integration guidance** - How to use with Claude Code
6. **Testing instructions** - How to validate the skill works

## Example Workflow

**User Request**: "Create a skill for analyzing code quality"

**Agent Response**:
1. Analyze requirements and determine skill scope
2. Create SKILL.md with:
   - Frontmatter with metadata
   - Capabilities section listing what it analyzes
   - How to Use with clear instructions
   - Input format (supported languages, file types)
   - Output format (report structure, metrics)
   - Examples with natural language prompts
   - Best practices for code quality
   - Limitations (languages not supported)
3. Suggest optional scripts/ for metric calculation
4. Provide quality checklist verification
5. Include integration examples with related skills
