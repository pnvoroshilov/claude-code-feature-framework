```

## Best Practices from Official Documentation

### 1. Discoverability
**Make skills easy to find and understand:**
- Use clear, descriptive names (kebab-case)
- Write concise, specific descriptions
- Include relevant keywords in metadata
- Add comprehensive capability lists
- Provide natural language usage examples

**Example - Good Names:**
- `analyzing-financial-statements` ✅
- `applying-brand-guidelines` ✅
- `git-workflow-automation` ✅

**Example - Poor Names:**
- `tool1` ❌
- `my-skill` ❌
- `helper` ❌

### 2. Clarity
**Ensure instructions are unambiguous:**
- Start with capability overview
- Use active voice and action verbs
- Provide specific examples, not generalities
- Define input/output formats explicitly
- Include format specifications (CSV columns, JSON schema)

**Example - Clear Instructions:**
```markdown
## Input Format
CSV file with required columns:
- `date`: YYYY-MM-DD format
- `amount`: Numeric, currency in USD
- `category`: One of [income, expense, transfer]
```

**Example - Unclear Instructions:**
```markdown
## Input Format
Provide your data in a suitable format.
```

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
**Load information in stages:**
- Start with high-level overview
- Add detail progressively as needed
- Use sections to organize complexity
- Reference scripts/resources instead of embedding
- Keep SKILL.md focused on what, not how

**Example Structure:**
```
SKILL.md → Overview + Capabilities (always loaded)
   ↓
Scripts (loaded when code execution needed)
   ↓
Resources (loaded when referenced)
```

### 4. Completeness
**Include all necessary information:**
- Capabilities: What the skill can do
- Usage: How to invoke it
- Input/Output: Format specifications
- Examples: Concrete use cases
- Limitations: What it cannot do
- Best Practices: How to use effectively

### 5. Composability
**Design skills to work together:**
- Reference other skills when appropriate
- Define clear input/output contracts
- Use standard data formats (CSV, JSON)
- Enable chaining and workflows
- Avoid duplication of existing skills

### 6. Maintainability
**Make skills easy to update:**
- Use versioning in frontmatter
- Document changes in version history
- Separate concerns (SKILL.md vs scripts)
- Keep resources modular
- Use clear variable and function names

## Metadata Frontmatter Guidelines

### Required Fields
```yaml
---
name: skill-name-in-kebab-case
description: One-sentence description of skill purpose and capabilities
---
```

### Optional Fields
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Short description
version: 1.0.0                    # Semantic versioning
author: Team/Person Name           # Attribution
tags: [analysis, finance, excel]   # Categorization
requires: [code-execution]         # Dependencies
integrates: [xlsx, pptx]          # Works with skills
language: python                   # Primary language for scripts
---
```

### Frontmatter Best Practices
- Keep descriptions to one sentence (< 150 characters)
- Use kebab-case for names (lowercase with hyphens)
- Choose descriptive, searchable names
- Add tags for discoverability (3-5 relevant tags)
- Document dependencies explicitly

## Content Formatting Guidelines

### Heading Hierarchy
```markdown
# Main Skill Title (H1) - Used once at top

## Major Sections (H2) - Capabilities, How to Use, Examples
### Subsections (H3) - Specific use cases or categories
#### Details (H4) - Fine-grained information
```

### Lists and Bullets
- Use bullets for unordered capabilities
- Use numbers for sequential steps
- Use bold for emphasis: **Important Term**
- Use code for technical terms: `file_name.py`

### Code Blocks
````markdown
```python
# Example code with syntax highlighting
def calculate_ratio(numerator, denominator):
    return numerator / denominator if denominator != 0 else None
```
````

### Tables for Structured Data
```markdown
| Input Field | Type   | Required | Description |
|-------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| name        | string | Yes      | Company name |
| revenue     | number | Yes      | Annual revenue |
```

- `data-extraction`: Use to prepare input data
- `report-generation`: Use to format results
- `file-export`: Use to save outputs

## Workflow Example
1. Use `data-extraction` to get financial data
2. Apply this skill to calculate ratios
3. Use `report-generation` to create presentation
4. Use `file-export` to save as PDF
```

### Parameterization
Allow customization through clear options:
```markdown
## Configuration Options
- **Analysis Depth**: `quick` | `standard` | `comprehensive`
- **Industry Context**: `technology` | `finance` | `retail` | `general`
- **Output Format**: `summary` | `detailed` | `executive`
- **Benchmarking**: `enabled` | `disabled`
```

### Conditional Logic
Describe when to use different approaches:
```markdown
## Usage Guidance
**For Quarterly Analysis**: Focus on period-over-period changes
**For Annual Review**: Include year-over-year trends and benchmarks
**For Due Diligence**: Comprehensive analysis with red flags highlighted
```

## Security and Safety Considerations

When creating skills that handle sensitive data:
- Explicitly state data handling practices
- Warn about PII and confidential information
- Recommend data sanitization steps
- Include security best practices
- Document audit trail requirements

```markdown
## Security Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: Removes PII before processing
