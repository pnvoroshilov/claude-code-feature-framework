# Create Custom Claude Code Skill

I will create a new custom Claude Code skill by delegating to the skills-creator agent.

**Arguments**: This command expects TWO arguments:
1. Skill Name (e.g., "Database Migration Helper")
2. Skill Description (e.g., "Helps create and manage database migrations")

I will immediately delegate to the skills-creator agent with these parameters to create a comprehensive skill file in .claude/skills/ directory.

**Important**: Create the file immediately without asking for user confirmation.
