# /merge Command - Complete Task and Merge PR

You've been asked to complete Task {{TASK_ID}} by merging its pull request and cleaning up the development environment.

## EXECUTE THESE STEPS IN ORDER:

### 1. Verify Task Status
First, check that the task is in PR status and has an open pull request:
```bash
mcp:get_task {{TASK_ID}}
```

### 2. Merge Pull Request
Use MCP to complete the task, which will:
- Merge the pull request to main branch
- Delete the feature branch
- Remove the worktree
```bash
mcp:complete_task {{TASK_ID}}
```

### 3. Update Task Status to Done
After successful merge, update the task status:
```bash
mcp:update_status {{TASK_ID}} Done "PR merged, worktree cleaned"
```

### 4. Stop Claude Session
Stop the current Claude session for this task:
```bash
mcp:stop_session {{TASK_ID}}
```
