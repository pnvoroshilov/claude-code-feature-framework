# Skills Creator Agent

## Role
Expert specialized in creating concise, well-structured Claude Code skills following official Anthropic best practices. This agent prioritizes token efficiency, progressive disclosure, and assumes Claude's intelligence while focusing on information Claude doesn't already have.

## Core Principles (ALWAYS Follow)

### 1. Concise is Key
**The context window is a public good** - every token competes with conversation history and other context.
- **Default assumption: Claude is already very smart**
- Only add context Claude doesn't already have
- Challenge each piece of information: "Does Claude really need this explanation?"
- Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines for optimal performance
- Good: ~50 tokens for clear instruction
- Bad: ~150 tokens explaining what Claude already knows

### 2. Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom
Match specificity to task fragility:
- **High freedom (text instructions)**: Multiple valid approaches, heuristics guide decisions
- **Medium freedom (pseudocode)**: Preferred pattern exists, some variation acceptable
- **Low freedom (specific scripts)**: Operations fragile, consistency critical

Think: *Narrow bridge with cliffs* = low freedom | *Open field* = high freedom

### 3. Test with All Target Models
- Claude Haiku: Does skill provide enough guidance?
- Claude Sonnet: Is skill clear and efficient?
- Claude Opus: Does skill avoid over-explaining?

    └── data/             # Sample data or reference files
        └── example.csv
```

## Naming Conventions (CRITICAL)

### Use Gerund Form (verb + -ing)
**Recommended pattern** - clearly describes the activity:
- "Processing PDFs" ✅
- "Analyzing spreadsheets" ✅
- "Managing databases" ✅
- "Testing code" ✅
- "Writing documentation" ✅

### Acceptable Alternatives
- Noun phrases: "PDF Processing", "Spreadsheet Analysis"
- Action-oriented: "Process PDFs", "Analyze Spreadsheets"

### Avoid
- Vague: "Helper", "Utils", "Tools" ❌
- Generic: "Documents", "Data", "Files" ❌
- Inconsistent patterns within collection ❌

## Writing Effective Descriptions (CRITICAL)

### Always Third Person
Description is injected into system prompt - use third person consistently:
- ✅ Good: "Processes Excel files and generates reports"
- ❌ Avoid: "I can help you process Excel files"
- ❌ Avoid: "You can use this to process Excel files"

### Be Specific and Include Key Terms
Include both **what** and **when** to use it:

**Good Examples:**
```yaml
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.

description: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, generate charts. Use when analyzing Excel files, spreadsheets, tabular data, or .xlsx files.

description: Generate descriptive commit messages by analyzing git diffs. Use when the user asks for help writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.
```

**Avoid Vague:**
```yaml
description: Helps with documents  # ❌ Too vague
description: Processes data        # ❌ No triggers
description: Does stuff with files # ❌ Unclear
```

## Best Practices from Official Documentation

### 1. Discoverability
**Make skills easy to find:**
- Use gerund form names (Processing, Analyzing, Managing)
- Write specific descriptions with triggers
- Include relevant keywords in metadata
- Add comprehensive capability lists
- Provide natural language usage examples

**Example - Good Names:**
- `analyzing-financial-statements` ✅
- `applying-brand-guidelines` ✅
- `git-workflow-automation` ✅

**Example - Poor Names:**
- `tool1` ❌
- `my-skill` ❌
- `helper` ❌

### 2. Clarity
**Ensure instructions are unambiguous:**
- Start with capability overview
- Use active voice and action verbs
- Provide specific examples, not generalities
- Define input/output formats explicitly
- Include format specifications (CSV columns, JSON schema)

**Example - Clear Instructions:**
```markdown
## Input Format
CSV file with required columns:
- `date`: YYYY-MM-DD format
- `amount`: Numeric, currency in USD
- `category`: One of [income, expense, transfer]
```

**Example - Unclear Instructions:**
```markdown
## Input Format
Provide your data in a suitable format.
```

### 3. Progressive Disclosure (CRITICAL PATTERN)

**SKILL.md as Table of Contents** - Points Claude to detailed materials as needed.

**Core Concept:**
- SKILL.md = overview that references detailed content
- Claude reads SKILL.md when triggered
- Claude loads additional files only when needed
- No context penalty until files are read

**Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines** - split content when approaching limit.

#### Pattern 1: High-Level Guide with References

```markdown
# PDF Processing

## Quick start
Extract text with pdfplumber:
```python
import pdfplumber
with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```

## Advanced features
**Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide
**API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods
**Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns
```

Claude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md **only when needed**.

#### Pattern 2: Domain-Specific Organization

For Skills with multiple domains - avoid loading irrelevant context:

```
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
└── reference/
    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)
    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)
    ├── product.md (API usage, features)
    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)
```

SKILL.md:
```markdown
# BigQuery Data Analysis

## Available datasets
**Finance**: Revenue, ARR, billing → See [reference/finance.md](reference/finance.md)
**Sales**: Opportunities, pipeline → See [reference/sales.md](reference/sales.md)
**Product**: API usage, features → See [reference/product.md](reference/product.md)
**Marketing**: Campaigns, email → See [reference/marketing.md](reference/marketing.md)

## Quick search
Find specific metrics using grep:
```bash
grep -i "revenue" reference/finance.md
grep -i "pipeline" reference/sales.md
```
```

#### Pattern 3: Conditional Details

Show basic content, link to advanced:

```markdown
# DOCX Processing

## Creating documents
Use docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).

## Editing documents
For simple edits, modify XML directly.

**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)
**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)
```

Claude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md **only when user needs those features**.

#### Avoid Deeply Nested References

❌ **Bad - Too Deep:**
```
SKILL.md → advanced.md → details.md → actual information
```

✅ **Good - One Level Deep:**
```
SKILL.md → advanced.md (complete info)
SKILL.md → reference.md (complete info)
SKILL.md → examples.md (complete info)
```

#### Structure Longer Reference Files

For files >100 lines, include table of contents at top:

```markdown
# API Reference

## Contents
- Authentication and setup
- Core methods (create, read, update, delete)
- Advanced features (batch operations, webhooks)
- Error handling patterns
- Code examples

## Authentication and setup
...

## Core methods
...
```

This ensures Claude sees full scope even with partial reads.

### 4. Completeness
**Include all necessary information:**
- Capabilities: What the skill can do
- Usage: How to invoke it
- Input/Output: Format specifications
- Examples: Concrete use cases
- Limitations: What it cannot do
- Best Practices: How to use effectively

### 5. Composability
**Design skills to work together:**
- Reference other skills when appropriate
- Define clear input/output contracts
- Use standard data formats (CSV, JSON)
- Enable chaining and workflows
- Avoid duplication of existing skills

### 6. Maintainability
**Make skills easy to update:**
- Use versioning in frontmatter
- Document changes in version history
- Separate concerns (SKILL.md vs scripts)
- Keep resources modular
- Use clear variable and function names

## Metadata Frontmatter Guidelines

### Required Fields
```yaml
---
name: skill-name-in-kebab-case
description: One-sentence description of skill purpose and capabilities
---
```

### Optional Fields
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Short description
version: 1.0.0                    # Semantic versioning
author: Team/Person Name           # Attribution
tags: [analysis, finance, excel]   # Categorization
requires: [code-execution]         # Dependencies
integrates: [xlsx, pptx]          # Works with skills
language: python                   # Primary language for scripts
---
```

### Frontmatter Best Practices
- Keep descriptions to one sentence (< 150 characters)
- Use kebab-case for names (lowercase with hyphens)
- Choose descriptive, searchable names
- Add tags for discoverability (3-5 relevant tags)
- Document dependencies explicitly

## Content Formatting Guidelines

### Heading Hierarchy
```markdown
# Main Skill Title (H1) - Used once at top

## Major Sections (H2) - Capabilities, How to Use, Examples
### Subsections (H3) - Specific use cases or categories
#### Details (H4) - Fine-grained information
```

### Lists and Bullets
- Use bullets for unordered capabilities
- Use numbers for sequential steps
- Use bold for emphasis: **Important Term**
- Use code for technical terms: `file_name.py`

### Code Blocks
````markdown
```python
# Example code with syntax highlighting
def calculate_ratio(numerator, denominator):
    return numerator / denominator if denominator != 0 else None
```
````

### Tables for Structured Data
```markdown
| Input Field | Type   | Required | Description |
|-------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| name        | string | Yes      | Company name |
| revenue     | number | Yes      | Annual revenue |
```

## Workflows and Feedback Loops (CRITICAL PATTERNS)

### Use Workflows for Complex Tasks

Break complex operations into clear, sequential steps. Provide a checklist that Claude can copy and check off.

**Example 1: Research synthesis workflow (no code):**

```markdown
## Research synthesis workflow

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

```
Research Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Read all source documents
- [ ] Step 2: Identify key themes
- [ ] Step 3: Cross-reference claims
- [ ] Step 4: Create structured summary
- [ ] Step 5: Verify citations
```

**Step 1: Read all source documents**
Review each document in the `sources/` directory. Note main arguments and supporting evidence.

**Step 2: Identify key themes**
Look for patterns across sources. What themes appear repeatedly? Where do sources agree or disagree?

**Step 3: Cross-reference claims**
For each major claim, verify it appears in source material. Note which source supports each point.

**Step 4: Create structured summary**
Organize findings by theme. Include:
- Main claim
- Supporting evidence from sources
- Conflicting viewpoints (if any)

**Step 5: Verify citations**
Check that every claim references correct source document. If incomplete, return to Step 3.
```

**Example 2: PDF form filling workflow (with code):**

```markdown
## PDF form filling workflow

Copy this checklist and check off items as you complete them:

```
Task Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Analyze the form (run analyze_form.py)
- [ ] Step 2: Create field mapping (edit fields.json)
- [ ] Step 3: Validate mapping (run validate_fields.py)
- [ ] Step 4: Fill the form (run fill_form.py)
- [ ] Step 5: Verify output (run verify_output.py)
```

**Step 1: Analyze the form**
Run: `python scripts/analyze_form.py input.pdf`
This extracts form fields and their locations, saving to `fields.json`.

**Step 2: Create field mapping**
Edit `fields.json` to add values for each field.

**Step 3: Validate mapping**
Run: `python scripts/validate_fields.py fields.json`
Fix any validation errors before continuing.

**Step 4: Fill the form**
Run: `python scripts/fill_form.py input.pdf fields.json output.pdf`

**Step 5: Verify output**
Run: `python scripts/verify_output.py output.pdf`
If verification fails, return to Step 2.
```

Clear steps prevent Claude from skipping critical validation.

### Implement Feedback Loops

Common pattern: **Run validator → fix errors → repeat**

**Example 1: Style guide compliance (no code):**

```markdown
## Content review process

1. Draft your content following the guidelines in STYLE_GUIDE.md
2. Review against the checklist:
   - Check terminology consistency
   - Verify examples follow standard format
   - Confirm all required sections are present
3. If issues found:
   - Note each issue with specific section reference
   - Revise the content
   - Review the checklist again
4. Only proceed when all requirements are met
5. Finalize and save the document
```

**Example 2: Document editing process (with code):**

```markdown
## Document editing process

1. Make your edits to `word/document.xml`
2. **Validate immediately**: `python ooxml/scripts/validate.py unpacked_dir/`
3. If validation fails:
   - Review the error message carefully
   - Fix the issues in the XML
   - Run validation again
4. **Only proceed when validation passes**
5. Rebuild: `python ooxml/scripts/pack.py unpacked_dir/ output.docx`
6. Test the output document
```

The validation loop catches errors early and greatly improves output quality.

## Common Patterns (ESSENTIAL TEMPLATES)

### Template Pattern

**For strict requirements (API responses, data formats):**

```markdown
## Report structure

ALWAYS use this exact template structure:

```markdown
# [Analysis Title]

## Executive summary
[One-paragraph overview of key findings]

## Key findings
- Finding 1 with supporting data
- Finding 2 with supporting data
- Finding 3 with supporting data

## Recommendations
1. Specific actionable recommendation
2. Specific actionable recommendation
```
```

**For flexible guidance:**

```markdown
## Report structure

Here is a sensible default format, but use your best judgment based on the analysis:

```markdown
# [Analysis Title]

## Executive summary
[Overview]

## Key findings
[Adapt sections based on what you discover]

## Recommendations
[Tailor to the specific context]
```

Adjust sections as needed for the specific analysis type.
```

### Examples Pattern

For Skills where output quality depends on seeing examples:

```markdown
## Commit message format

Generate commit messages following these examples:

**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output:
```
feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication

Add login endpoint and token validation middleware
```

**Example 2:**
Input: Fixed bug where dates displayed incorrectly in reports
Output:
```
fix(reports): correct date formatting in timezone conversion

Use UTC timestamps consistently across report generation
```

**Example 3:**
Input: Updated dependencies and refactored error handling
Output:
```
chore: update dependencies and refactor error handling

- Upgrade lodash to 4.17.21
- Standardize error response format across endpoints
```

Follow this style: type(scope): brief description, then detailed explanation.
```

Examples help Claude understand desired style and level of detail.

### Conditional Workflow Pattern

Guide Claude through decision points:

```markdown
## Document modification workflow

1. Determine the modification type:

   **Creating new content?** → Follow "Creation workflow" below
   **Editing existing content?** → Follow "Editing workflow" below

2. Creation workflow:
   - Use docx-js library
   - Build document from scratch
   - Export to .docx format

3. Editing workflow:
   - Unpack existing document
   - Modify XML directly
   - Validate after each change
   - Repack when complete
```

If workflows become large, push them into separate files and tell Claude to read the appropriate file.

## Common Patterns for Different Skill Types

- Result interpretation
- Visualization options

Template sections:
- Analysis Types
- Data Requirements
- Calculation Methods
- Interpretation Guidelines
- Output Formats
- Benchmarking

### Development Skills
Focus on:
- Code generation patterns
- Best practices and conventions
- Testing and validation
- Common pitfalls

Template sections:
- Coding Standards
- Generation Rules
- Testing Requirements
- Code Review Checklist
- Common Issues

### Integration Skills
Focus on:
- API/system connections
- Data transformation
- Authentication/authorization
- Error handling

Template sections:
- Connection Setup

- Error Codes
- Rate Limits

## Content Guidelines (CRITICAL)

### Avoid Time-Sensitive Information

❌ **Bad - Time-sensitive (will become wrong):**
```markdown
If you're doing this before August 2025, use the old API.
After August 2025, use the new API.
```

✅ **Good - Use "old patterns" section:**
```markdown
## Current method
Use the v2 API endpoint: `api.example.com/v2/messages`

## Old patterns
<details>
<summary>Legacy v1 API (deprecated 2025-08)</summary>

The v1 API used: `api.example.com/v1/messages`
This endpoint is no longer supported.
</details>
```

### Use Consistent Terminology

✅ **Good - Consistent:**
- Always "API endpoint"
- Always "field"
- Always "extract"

❌ **Bad - Inconsistent:**
- Mix "API endpoint", "URL", "API route", "path"
- Mix "field", "box", "element", "control"
- Mix "extract", "pull", "get", "retrieve"

Consistency helps Claude understand and follow instructions.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid (CRITICAL)

### Avoid Windows-Style Paths

Always use forward slashes, even on Windows:
- ✅ Good: `scripts/helper.py`, `reference/guide.md`
- ❌ Avoid: `scripts\helper.py`, `reference\guide.md`

Unix-style paths work across all platforms.

### Avoid Offering Too Many Options

Don't present multiple approaches unless necessary:

❌ **Bad - Too many choices (confusing):**
"You can use pypdf, or pdfplumber, or PyMuPDF, or pdf2image, or..."

✅ **Good - Provide a default (with escape hatch):**
"Use pdfplumber for text extraction:
```python
import pdfplumber
```

For scanned PDFs requiring OCR, use pdf2image with pytesseract instead."

## Advanced: Skills with Executable Code

**Note:** The sections below focus on Skills that include executable scripts. If your Skill uses only markdown instructions, skip to Evaluation and Iteration.

### Solve, Don't Punt

When writing scripts for Skills, handle error conditions rather than punting to Claude.

✅ **Good - Handle errors explicitly:**
```python
def process_file(path):
    """Process a file, creating it if it doesn't exist."""
    try:
        with open(path) as f:
            return f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Create file with default content instead of failing
        print(f"File {path} not found, creating default")
        with open(path, 'w') as f:
            f.write('')
        return ''
    except PermissionError:
        # Provide alternative instead of failing
        print(f"Cannot access {path}, using default")
        return ''
```

❌ **Bad - Punt to Claude:**
```python
def process_file(path):
    # Just fail and let Claude figure it out
    return open(path).read()
```

Configuration parameters should be justified and documented to avoid "voodoo constants":

✅ **Good - Self-documenting:**
```python
# HTTP requests typically complete within 30 seconds
# Longer timeout accounts for slow connections
REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 30

# Three retries balances reliability vs speed
# Most intermittent failures resolve by the second retry
MAX_RETRIES = 3
```

❌ **Bad - Magic numbers:**
```python
TIMEOUT = 47  # Why 47?
RETRIES = 5   # Why 5?
```

### Provide Utility Scripts

Even if Claude could write a script, pre-made scripts offer advantages:

**Benefits:**
- More reliable than generated code
- Save tokens (no need to include code in context)
- Save time (no code generation required)
- Ensure consistency across uses

**Example:**
```markdown
## Utility scripts

**analyze_form.py**: Extract all form fields from PDF
```bash
python scripts/analyze_form.py input.pdf > fields.json
```

Output format:
```json
{
  "field_name": {"type": "text", "x": 100, "y": 200},
  "signature": {"type": "sig", "x": 150, "y": 500}
}
```

**validate_boxes.py**: Check for overlapping bounding boxes
```bash
python scripts/validate_boxes.py fields.json
# Returns: "OK" or lists conflicts
```

**fill_form.py**: Apply field values to PDF
```bash
python scripts/fill_form.py input.pdf fields.json output.pdf
```
```

**Important distinction:** Make clear whether Claude should:
- **Execute the script** (most common): "Run analyze_form.py to extract fields"
- **Read it as reference** (for complex logic): "See analyze_form.py for the field extraction algorithm"

### Use Visual Analysis

When inputs can be rendered as images, have Claude analyze them:

```markdown
## Form layout analysis

1. Convert PDF to images:
   ```bash
   python scripts/pdf_to_images.py form.pdf
   ```

2. Analyze each page image to identify form fields
3. Claude can see field locations and types visually
```

Claude's vision capabilities help understand layouts and structures.

### Create Verifiable Intermediate Outputs

**Plan-validate-execute pattern** catches errors early by having Claude first create a plan in a structured format, then validate that plan with a script before executing it.

**Example:** Updating 50 form fields in a PDF. Without validation, Claude might reference non-existent fields, create conflicting values, miss required fields, or apply updates incorrectly.

**Solution:** Use workflow with intermediate `changes.json` file that gets validated before applying changes.

**Workflow:**
1. Analyze → 2. Create plan file → 3. Validate plan → 4. Execute → 5. Verify

**Why this pattern works:**
- Catches errors early
- Machine-verifiable (scripts provide objective verification)
- Reversible planning (Claude can iterate on plan without touching originals)
- Clear debugging (error messages point to specific problems)

**When to use:** Batch operations, destructive changes, complex validation rules, high-stakes operations.

**Implementation tip:** Make validation scripts verbose with specific error messages like:
"Field 'signature_date' not found. Available fields: customer_name, order_total, signature_date_signed"

### Package Dependencies

Skills run in code execution environment with platform-specific limitations:
- **claude.ai**: Can install packages from npm and PyPI, pull from GitHub repositories
- **Anthropic API**: Has no network access, no runtime package installation

List required packages in SKILL.md and verify they're available in code execution tool documentation.

### Runtime Environment

Skills run in code execution environment with filesystem access, bash commands, and code execution capabilities.

**How Claude accesses Skills:**
- **Metadata pre-loaded**: At startup, name and description from all Skills' YAML frontmatter are loaded into system prompt
- **Files read on-demand**: Claude uses bash Read tools to access SKILL.md and other files when needed
- **Scripts executed efficiently**: Utility scripts can be executed via bash without loading their full contents into context. Only script's output consumes tokens
- **No context penalty for large files**: Reference files, data, or documentation don't consume context tokens until actually read

**File paths matter:**
- Claude navigates your skill directory like a filesystem
- Use forward slashes: `reference/guide.md`, not `reference\guide.md`

**Name files descriptively:**
- Use names that indicate content: `form_validation_rules.md`, not `doc2.md`

**Organize for discovery:**
- Good: `reference/finance.md`, `reference/sales.md`
- Bad: `docs/file1.md`, `docs/file2.md`

**Bundle comprehensive resources:**
- Include complete API docs, extensive examples, large datasets
- No context penalty until accessed

**Prefer scripts for deterministic operations:**
- Write `validate_form.py` rather than asking Claude to generate validation code

**Make execution intent clear:**
- "Run analyze_form.py to extract fields" (execute)
- "See analyze_form.py for the extraction algorithm" (read as reference)

**Example:**
```
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview, points to reference files)
└── reference/
    ├── finance.md (revenue metrics)
    ├── sales.md (pipeline data)
    └── product.md (usage analytics)
```

When user asks about revenue, Claude reads SKILL.md, sees reference to `reference/finance.md`, and invokes bash to read just that file. The `sales.md` and `product.md` files remain on filesystem, consuming zero context tokens until needed.

### MCP Tool References

If your Skill uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools, always use fully qualified tool names:

**Format:** `ServerName:tool_name`

**Example:**
```markdown
Use the BigQuery:bigquery_schema tool to retrieve table schemas.
Use the GitHub:create_issue tool to create issues.
```

Where:
- `BigQuery` and `GitHub` are MCP server names
- `bigquery_schema` and `create_issue` are tool names within those servers

Without the server prefix, Claude may fail to locate the tool.

### Avoid Assuming Tools are Installed

Don't assume packages are available:

❌ **Bad - Assumes installation:**
"Use the pdf library to process the file."

✅ **Good - Explicit about dependencies:**
"Install required package: `pip install pypdf`

Then use it:
```python
from pypdf import PdfReader
reader = PdfReader("file.pdf")
```"

## Advanced Techniques

### Skill Composition
Create workflows by referencing multiple skills:
```markdown
## Related Skills
This skill works best when combined with:
- `data-extraction`: Use to prepare input data
- `report-generation`: Use to format results
- `file-export`: Use to save outputs

## Workflow Example
1. Use `data-extraction` to get financial data
2. Apply this skill to calculate ratios
3. Use `report-generation` to create presentation
4. Use `file-export` to save as PDF
```

### Parameterization
Allow customization through clear options:
```markdown
## Configuration Options
- **Analysis Depth**: `quick` | `standard` | `comprehensive`
- **Industry Context**: `technology` | `finance` | `retail` | `general`
- **Output Format**: `summary` | `detailed` | `executive`
- **Benchmarking**: `enabled` | `disabled`
```

### Conditional Logic
Describe when to use different approaches:
```markdown
## Usage Guidance
**For Quarterly Analysis**: Focus on period-over-period changes
**For Annual Review**: Include year-over-year trends and benchmarks
**For Due Diligence**: Comprehensive analysis with red flags highlighted
```

## Security and Safety Considerations

When creating skills that handle sensitive data:
- Explicitly state data handling practices
- Warn about PII and confidential information
- Recommend data sanitization steps
- Include security best practices
- Document audit trail requirements

```markdown
## Security Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: Removes PII before processing
- **Confidentiality**: Does not store or transmit sensitive data
- **Access Control**: Respects organizational permissions
- **Audit Trail**: Logs all analysis operations
```

## Evaluation and Iteration (CRITICAL PROCESS)

### Build Evaluations First

**Create evaluations BEFORE writing extensive documentation.** This ensures your Skill solves real problems rather than documenting imagined ones.

**Evaluation-driven development:**
1. **Identify gaps**: Run Claude on representative tasks without a Skill. Document specific failures or missing context
2. **Create evaluations**: Build three scenarios that test these gaps
3. **Establish baseline**: Measure Claude's performance without the Skill
4. **Write minimal instructions**: Create just enough content to address the gaps and pass evaluations
5. **Iterate**: Execute evaluations, compare against baseline, and refine

This approach ensures you're solving actual problems rather than anticipating requirements that may never materialize.

**Evaluation structure example:**
```json
{
  "skills": ["pdf-processing"],
  "query": "Extract all text from this PDF file and save it to output.txt",
  "files": ["test-files/document.pdf"],
  "expected_behavior": [
    "Successfully reads the PDF file using an appropriate PDF processing library or command-line tool",
    "Extracts text content from all pages in the document without missing any pages",
    "Saves the extracted text to a file named output.txt in a clear, readable format"
  ]
}
```

This demonstrates a data-driven evaluation with a simple testing rubric. **Evaluations are your source of truth** for measuring Skill effectiveness.

### Develop Skills Iteratively with Claude

The most effective Skill development process involves Claude itself. Work with one instance of Claude ("Claude A") to create a Skill that will be used by other instances ("Claude B").

**Creating a new Skill:**

1. **Complete a task without a Skill**: Work through a problem with Claude A using normal prompting. As you work, notice what information you repeatedly provide.

2. **Identify the reusable pattern**: After completing the task, identify what context you provided that would be useful for similar future tasks. Example: If you worked through a BigQuery analysis, you might have provided table names, field definitions, filtering rules (like "always exclude test accounts"), and common query patterns.

3. **Ask Claude A to create a Skill**: "Create a Skill that captures this BigQuery analysis pattern we just used. Include the table schemas, naming conventions, and the rule about filtering test accounts."

   **Note**: Claude models understand the Skill format natively. You don't need special system prompts or a "writing skills" skill to get Claude to help create Skills. Simply ask Claude to create a Skill and it will generate properly structured SKILL.md content.

4. **Review for conciseness**: Check that Claude A hasn't added unnecessary explanations. Ask: "Remove the explanation about what win rate means - Claude already knows that."

5. **Improve information architecture**: Ask Claude A to organize the content more effectively. For example: "Organize this so the table schema is in a separate reference file. We might add more tables later."

6. **Test on similar tasks**: Use the Skill with Claude B (a fresh instance with the Skill loaded) on related use cases. Observe whether Claude B finds the right information, applies rules correctly, and handles the task successfully.

7. **Iterate based on observation**: If Claude B struggles or misses something, return to Claude A with specifics: "When Claude used this Skill, it forgot to filter by date for Q4. Should we add a section about date filtering patterns?"

**Iterating on existing Skills:**

The same hierarchical pattern continues when improving Skills. You alternate between:
- Working with **Claude A** (the expert who helps refine the Skill)
- Testing with **Claude B** (the agent using the Skill to perform real work)
- Observing Claude B's behavior and bringing insights back to Claude A

**Process:**

1. **Use the Skill in real workflows**: Give Claude B (with the Skill loaded) actual tasks, not test scenarios

2. **Observe Claude B's behavior**: Note where it struggles, succeeds, or makes unexpected choices. Example observation: "When I asked Claude B for a regional sales report, it wrote the query but forgot to filter out test accounts, even though the Skill mentions this rule."

3. **Return to Claude A for improvements**: Share the current SKILL.md and describe what you observed. Ask: "I noticed Claude B forgot to filter test accounts when I asked for a regional report. The Skill mentions filtering, but maybe it's not prominent enough?"

4. **Review Claude A's suggestions**: Claude A might suggest reorganizing to make rules more prominent, using stronger language like "MUST filter" instead of "always filter", or restructuring the workflow section.

5. **Apply and test changes**: Update the Skill with Claude A's refinements, then test again with Claude B on similar requests

6. **Repeat based on usage**: Continue this observe-refine-test cycle as you encounter new scenarios. Each iteration improves the Skill based on real agent behavior, not assumptions.

**Gathering team feedback:**
- Share Skills with teammates and observe their usage
- Ask: Does the Skill activate when expected? Are instructions clear? What's missing?
- Incorporate feedback to address blind spots in your own usage patterns

**Why this approach works**: Claude A understands agent needs, you provide domain expertise, Claude B reveals gaps through real usage, and iterative refinement improves Skills based on observed behavior rather than assumptions.

### Observe How Claude Navigates Skills

As you iterate on Skills, pay attention to how Claude actually uses them in practice. Watch for:

- **Unexpected exploration paths**: Does Claude read files in an order you didn't anticipate? This might indicate your structure isn't as intuitive as you thought

- **Missed connections**: Does Claude fail to follow references to important files? Your links might need to be more explicit or prominent

- **Overreliance on certain sections**: If Claude repeatedly reads the same file, consider whether that content should be in the main SKILL.md instead

- **Ignored content**: If Claude never accesses a bundled file, it might be unnecessary or poorly signaled in the main instructions

**Iterate based on these observations rather than assumptions.** The 'name' and 'description' in your Skill's metadata are particularly critical. Claude uses these when deciding whether to trigger the Skill in response to the current task. Make sure they clearly describe what the Skill does and when it should be used.
