## 🔒 CRITICAL: Browser Isolation Requirements

### ALWAYS Run Tests in Isolated Browser Context
**⚠️ MANDATORY SECURITY PRACTICE:**
- **NEVER** use your personal browser profile for testing
- **ALWAYS** start fresh browser instance for each test session
- **ALWAYS** use incognito/private mode equivalent
- **CLEAR** all cookies, cache, and storage between test runs
- **ISOLATE** test environment from production data

### Browser Isolation Checklist:
```
✅ Fresh browser instance for each test
✅ No saved passwords or autofill data
✅ No browser extensions active
✅ Isolated from personal browsing data
✅ Clean state between test runs
✅ Separate test user accounts
✅ No access to production credentials
```

### MCP Playwright Isolation Best Practices:
1. **Start Fresh**: Always begin with `mcp__playwright__browser_close` if a session exists
2. **Clean State**: Browser starts in isolated context automatically via MCP
3. **No Persistence**: Data doesn't persist between test sessions
4. **Safe Testing**: Isolated from your personal browser and data

## Test Implementation Patterns

### MCP Playwright Testing Workflow

#### 0. 🔒 ALWAYS Start with Clean Isolation
```bash
# CRITICAL: Ensure clean isolated browser state
mcp__playwright__browser_close  # Close any existing session

# If browser not installed, install it first
mcp__playwright__browser_install

# Now start fresh isolated session
# Browser will launch in isolated context automatically
```

#### 1. Basic Navigation and Validation
```bash
# Navigate to application (browser launches in isolation)
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate --url="http://localhost:3000"

# Take snapshot of page structure
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot

# Capture screenshot for visual validation
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot --filename="homepage.png"
```

#### 2. Form Testing Example
```bash
# Navigate to registration page
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate --url="http://localhost:3000/register"

# Fill registration form
mcp__playwright__browser_fill_form --fields='[
  {"name": "Email", "ref": "input[name=email]", "type": "textbox", "value": "user@example.com"},
  {"name": "Password", "ref": "input[name=password]", "type": "textbox", "value": "SecurePass123!"},
  {"name": "Terms", "ref": "input[type=checkbox]", "type": "checkbox", "value": "true"}
]'

# Click submit button
mcp__playwright__browser_click --element="Submit button" --ref="button[type=submit]"

# Wait for navigation
mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for --text="Welcome to Dashboard"

# Validate success
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot
```

#### 3. Cross-Browser Testing
```bash
# Test in different viewport sizes
mcp__playwright__browser_resize --width=1920 --height=1080  # Desktop
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot --filename="desktop-view.png"

mcp__playwright__browser_resize --width=375 --height=667   # Mobile
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot --filename="mobile-view.png"

mcp__playwright__browser_resize --width=768 --height=1024  # Tablet
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot --filename="tablet-view.png"
```

#### 4. JavaScript Execution for Advanced Testing
```bash
# Check page performance metrics
mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate --function="() => {
  const perf = performance.timing;
  return {
    loadTime: perf.loadEventEnd - perf.navigationStart,
    domReady: perf.domContentLoadedEventEnd - perf.navigationStart,
    firstPaint: performance.getEntriesByType('paint')[0].startTime
  };
}"

# Validate element states
mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate --element="Submit button" --ref="button[type=submit]" --function="(el) => ({
  disabled: el.disabled,
  visible: el.offsetParent !== null,
  text: el.textContent
})"
```

#### 5. Network and Console Monitoring
```bash
# Check network requests
mcp__playwright__browser_network_requests

# Monitor console errors
mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages
```

## Debugging & Troubleshooting

### MCP Playwright Debug Techniques

#### 1. Browser Installation & Isolation Issues
```bash
# 🔒 ALWAYS ensure isolation first
mcp__playwright__browser_close  # Clean any existing session

# If browser not found, install it
mcp__playwright__browser_install

# Start fresh isolated session for debugging
# The browser will automatically launch in isolated context
```

#### 2. Element Selection Debugging
```bash
# Get page snapshot to see available elements
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot

# Use evaluate to check element presence
mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate --function="() => {
  return {
    buttons: Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('button')).map(b => ({
      text: b.textContent,
      id: b.id,
      class: b.className,
      disabled: b.disabled
    }))
  };
}"
```

#### 3. Wait Strategies
```bash
# Wait for specific text
mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for --text="Loading complete"

# Wait for element to disappear
mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for --textGone="Loading..."

# Fixed time wait (use sparingly)
mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for --time=2
```

#### 4. Network Debugging
```bash
# Check all network requests
mcp__playwright__browser_network_requests

# Monitor console for errors
mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages
```

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Element Not Found**
   - Use `browser_snapshot` to verify element presence
   - Check if element is in iframe (may need evaluate)
   - Ensure page is fully loaded with `wait_for`
   - Verify correct selector syntax

2. **Timing Issues**
   - Use explicit waits instead of fixed delays
   - Wait for specific content/elements
   - Check network requests completion
   - Monitor console for async errors

3. **Form Interaction Problems**
   - Use `browser_fill_form` for multiple fields
   - Verify field types match (textbox, checkbox, etc.)
   - Check for JavaScript validation
   - Use `browser_evaluate` to check field states

4. **Screenshot/Visual Issues**
   - Set viewport size explicitly with `browser_resize`
   - Wait for animations to complete
   - Capture full page vs viewport
   - Use consistent naming for comparison
